This project requires me to generate a dataframe of travellers that visited Singapore in a span of 10 years. Their regions were also to be included. The script includes error checking for each individual input provided by the user. The libraries used in my project are 'pandas' and 'matplotlib'. Data is shown visually through the use of pie charts to improve the user's experience and gain better insights. Select the main.py file to view the script.
